        <p>Delicious dumplings, especially of the soup variety, are popular in Taiwan. This version uses a filling of ground pork, napa cabbage, peppers, ginger, and cilantro to create bold flavor in each bite.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 heads napa cabbage, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch cilantro, chopped</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground pork</li>
            <li>3 jalapeno peppers, minced</li>
            <li>2 large egg whites</li>
            <li>1 (2 inch) piece ginger root, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 (16 ounce) packages potsticker wrappers, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            
            <li>Spread cabbage and cilantro over a clean dish towel. Gather up towel and squeeze out as much moisture from cabbage as possible.</li>

            <li>Transfer cabbage and cilantro to a large bowl. Add pork, jalape√±o peppers, egg whites, ginger, and sesame oil. Mix thoroughly with your hands. Season with salt and pepper.</li>

            <li>Line 2 baking sheets with waxed paper. Fill a small bowl with water.</li>

            <li>Hold a potsticker wrapper in the palm of your hand. Place a tablespoonful pork mixture in the center. Dip a finger in water and wet the edges of the wrapper. Fold up edges and pinch together to seal. Transfer dumpling to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wrappers and pork mixture.</li>

            <li>Place dumplings in the freezer until firm, about 2 hours. Transfer to large resealable plastic bags and store in the freezer.</li>
