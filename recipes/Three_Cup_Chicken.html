        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>San bei ji, also called three cup chicken, is a beloved recipe for chicken that's braised in equal parts soy sauce, sesame oil, and rice wine. The sauce has a sweet kick from a little white sugar and plenty of texture from the crispy Thai basil leaves.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>½ cup sesame oil</li>
            <li>10 slices fresh ginger</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup Chinese rice wine</li>
            <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup fresh Thai basil leaves</li>
            <li>3 dried whole red chilies</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>

            <li>Heat sesame oil in the same skillet. Add ginger and garlic; cook and stir until ginger begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Stir in reserved chicken, rice wine, soy sauce, water, and sugar; bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until there is only 1/4 cup of liquid left in the skillet, about 20 minutes.</li>

            <li>Stir in basil and chiles; increase heat to medium and continue cooking until liquid is almost gone.</li>
        </ol>
